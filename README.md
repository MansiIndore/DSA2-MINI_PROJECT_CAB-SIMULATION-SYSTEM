# DSA2_MINI-PROJECT-CAB-SIMULATION-SYSTEM


Data Structure used: Array and linked list 

OVERVIEW :
     We have made very simple version of OLA/UBER using JAVA . 
     We have created a graph where cab services will be provided and each location is provided with some drivers initially.
     We have used Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path 
     
     
Project is divided into two parts:

    1.Admin

    2.User
    
    3.Passenger


#Admin privilages:

    Admin can:

          1. Find daily profit
          
          2. Find total revenue

          3. Find total expenditure

          4. Find tatl expenditure on daily wages

          5. Find maximum travelled location

          6. Update fuel peices

          7. Change wage per KM rate
  
  
#Driver privilages:

    Driver can  

         1. Driver registration
         
         2. Know your daily wage
  
  
 #User privilages:

    User can  

        1. BOOK RIDE
  
  
Structure of project:

     
   
   
Assumption : 

     1. No traffic
             
     2. Only two car types considered (Micro, Sedan)
             
     3. Considered duration of project ,1 day
             
 Further Scope: 
 
        1. The program can be further extended to include more functionality of OLA/UBER webapp
       
        2. Instead of giving harcoded data of availabel hospital, we can attach data base
        
        3. Use UI like websit instead of console
        
        4. Cancel ride from user and driver end
        
        5. Add functionality like city tour where minimum spanning tree and a new graph can be created
